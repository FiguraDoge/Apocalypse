This is a todo list. (4/17)

Progress:
Boat mechanic and Climbing mechanic are ultimatly done!

TODO:
	From grading rubic:
	2. Second scene and 3rd mechanics
		We can make the second scene as the roof of the building, and the 3rd mechanics will be strike a match to light a bonfire on the roof.
		The good side is that we finished two tasks in one shoot, and by doing so, we do not need to worry about the last step to climb on the roof.
		The down side is that we probably will only have one building to climb. If we have multiple buidlings, they may share the same roof scene with serval difference.

	3. Audio
		5 3d audio

	4. Scene
		lighting

	5. Textures
		we could use shader. WhiteCity package can be converted to light shader by changing the shader property in the material of the prefab (Personal preference)
		Google image and apply (Also Personal preference), easy and quick.

	6. Animation (Must)
		Add fish/bird in to the water
